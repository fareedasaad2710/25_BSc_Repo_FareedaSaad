## 🎥 Demo Codes
Three demo scripts were implemented to showcase key functionalities of AutoAnnotate. You can find them in the `demos/` folder:
✅ **Demo 1:** 2D Vehicle Annotation using YOLO - This demo uses the YOLOv3 object detection model to automatically detect and annotate vehicles in an image. The script processes an input image, applies object detection, and highlights identified vehicles with bounding boxes.
✅ **Demo 2:** 3D Manual Vehicle Annotation - This demo showcases a manual 3D bounding box annotation for a car in an image. The script defines a set of 3D points representing the vehicle’s bounding box, calculates its dimensions and centroid, and visualizes the annotation with labeled key points and edges. The resulting image includes the bounding box with depth representation and a label indicating the car's position.
✅ **Demo 3:** Vehicle Annotation using CVAT - This demo demonstrates the process of manually annotating vehicle images using the CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) platform. Multiple vehicle images were uploaded to CVAT, where 3d bounding boxes and key feature points were manually labeled.
